    "**Step 1** : Takes a string and splits the sentence up into individual elements, which is then added to a list. The list would be composed of either `words or punctuation`. So if the string: *\"Hello there, would you like some soup?\"* was inputted into the function make_bow(), the list `['Hello', 'there', ',', 'would', 'you', 'like', 'some', 'soup', '?']`. What this does is remove any white space, and only store words, and punctuation. This is used when comparing sentences as you compare words each separate word to see how similar they are. Splitting the sentences up word by word, makes it easier to compare the sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2** : Takes the list of words and punctuation and *normalizes* it. This is done by first making all letters in each word lowercase. If words where not converted to the same case, comparisons of words 'Hello' and 'hello' would return false, when they are both the same word. Converting all words to same casing would stop errors like this. Numbers are replaced with the string **NUM**. This is done as numbers in a sentence are not required to check the similarity. This is because they have no meaning on their own, therefore, so we specify that there is a number but not what that number is. Therefore tokens `'1' and '4'` would both be normalized to **NUM**. In addition, ordinal indicators are normalized to **Nth** as again they have no meaning on their own. This means tokens such as, '1st' and '2nd' would both be normalized to **'Nth'**. The final line of the normalize function removes positive and negative decimals and replaces them with 'NUM'. This is the same as before as numbers have no meaning alone, so all positive and negative decimals will be normalized. I.e. `-88.8, +5.2234 and 5.6` would all be normalized to **`'NUM'`**. The regular expression is designed to work for a decimal with any number of decimal places along with a decimal without a type (positive (+) or negative (-)) in front.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3** : This step lemmatizes each word within the list. This means to replace a word with its dictionary head word. For example the words `*playing*, *'played'* and *'plays'`* would all be replaced with **play** as this is the root/head of each of the words. We know this as *plays* is the plural of play, *played* is the past tense of play and *playing* is the present tense of play. Makes comparisons more accurate as words in their initial form may not be comparable, but have similar/the same head words. Overall, makes comparisons easier and more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4** : This step is the removal of stop-words from the list. Stop-words are common words such as *'the'* and are defined by **stopwords.words('english')**. When comparing sentences, stop-words are not looked at as these do not effect similarity. These words would be used in all documents, and have no value when comparing similarity. I.e. the sentence 'The smallest man is eating cheese' and 'The house is 10 feet tall' are not similar at all, and only have two common words **The** and **is**. These are stop-words so if used when calculating similarity would calculate a much higher similarity than if not used, which would be more accurate. This method also implements **punctuation removal**. This is done using **for w in tokenlist if w.isalpha()**. As punctuation is not alphabetic character *(a-z)*, the punctuation elements are removed from the token list. This is needed as punctuation is not relevant when comparing documents. This means the list `['the', 'old', 'man', 'is', 'very', 'slow', '.']` would become `['the', 'old', 'man', 'is', 'very', 'slow']`  after punctuation removal and **`['old', 'man', 'very', 'slow']`** after removing stop-words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5** : Takes each token stored in the list **rep** and stores it as the key within dictionary **dict_rep**. The value is  set to zero and is incremented every time the word is found within list *rep*. Used to calculate `term frequency` which is used to calculate the `tf-idf` values, so is needed when calculating document similarity."

The function creates a copy of the collection and calculates the tf-idf values for each feature within the each document of the collection. The function uses tghe copy of the collection to override the value stored for each feature to the tf-idf value. Copy is used so that the collection of the tf-idf values can be returned and does not affect the original collection. The term frequency is calculated and multiplied by the idf value calculated using the function and the result is stored for each individudal feature in the copy of document in each collection. TF-IDF is intended to reflect how relevant a term is in a given document.\n",

    "The intuition behind it is that `if a word occurs multiple times in a document`, its `relevance` should be *boosted* as it should be more **meaningful** than other words that appear fewer times (TF). At the same time, if a word occurs many times in a document but also along many other documents, maybe it is because this word is just a `frequent word`; not because it was **relevant or meaningful** (IDF). In addition, some TF-IDF values can be applied to phrases. Below the code shows the tf-idf values calculated using the fucniton for the collection `wsj`: The higher the tf-idf value is, the rarer the word is."

Creates two `seperate noun lists`, one for nouns found in `medline collection`, and one for all nouns found in `wsj colleciton`. Iterates through each document in each collection, chekcing if each word in each doc is a noun. If it is a noun, it is added to the list of nouns.

    "i.e `{word:[hypernym1, hypernym2...]}`. **Hyponymy and Hypernymy** are linguistic terms which capture the idea of class inclusion, using super/sub classes to link words. An example of this is the word 'dog' would be a hyponym of 'animal', since it is a subclass of animal, all dogs are animals, while not all animals are dogs. Works by looping through noun lists for each collection one at a time. Creeates a temp list called *hypernyms_list* which will store all hypernyms of a given word. Checks if hypernym is *already* in the list, if it isnt, it is added to the list, and is stored with the word in the hypernym dictionary (for the given collection) along with any other hypernyms. The cell below prints the dictionary of hypernyms in the wsj collection for the word `rise`. As we can see all `hyponyms` of the word **rise** `(the hypernym)` are stored under the key 'rise'. This means words such as 'raise' and 'arise' are hyponyms of rise."

By saying that these two words are similar, if both the words occur frequently throughout documents, the `average similairy of the wsj documents containing these words would increase`. This is because some documents may use a different words, which have the same meaning to talk about the same thing. An example for the hypernyms in the wsj collection could be `lift` and `rise`.

Finds tghe sense which leads to the  *largest/highest overlap* between its dictionary definitions along with the current context. uses the top definition, to decide the most likely sense. I have chosen the **knowledge based method** as it the only method that i felt comftable programming, which also gave a *correct prediction* of the sense for the 3 most frequent words with 2 word senses. The *recursive* algorithm prints out each use of the 3 most frequent words with two senses in the entirity of the medline corpus.

    "`The Knowledge based system `I have produced takes a string and breaks it into sentences. For every sentence, it finds the occurrence of any of the 3 most frequently occurring words within the given collection. The simplifiedLesk method is then run on every individual word. This finds any and all the synsets of the given word and compares them to the other words in the sentence. If any intersections are found in the list of synsets the method calculates most likely sense of the word. This is determined by the sense with the most intersections. The definition of this `most likely sense` is then displayed along with the synset & number of intersections. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:** A strength of the alghorithm is that it does not just compare the word with the entire document but also the sentence it occurs within. This makes the result more reliable as there may be other senses of the same word which would makes sense wihtin other sentences in the same document but not necessarily in the sentence it was found in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**: Many semantic similarity measures can only be computed between words of same part-of-speech. This means that a particular semantic similarity measure may not cpature the correct/right semantic relationship between words. An example of this could be the word `skirt`, which has more than 1 sense. 1 sense of `skirt` is a **Garment hanging from the waist, mainily worn by women** while another sense is **slang for a women**. The sentence `The old **woman** hid it in her **skirt**`. The system possibly would not capture the correct semantic realtionship between words here.. So one weakness of knowledge based systems is that if a sentence has a word twice, but each word is of a different sense. This may cause the system to be inaccurate in some cases. However that, maximising semantic similairty is an ideal approach to disambiguity. More weakness of my system include not using Case normalisation , Number normalisation, Stopword filering & Lemmitisation. By extending my system to use these methods, the accuracy of simularity would on average increases. Moreover doesnt use sense training on annotated data with a NB classifiers. This would ensure a greater accuracy when determining a sense of a word due to the classifier being trained, rather than relying on knowledge based methods. The Lesk algorithm is also computationally very expensive to compare all possible sense combinations of words in a sentence.  If each word has just 2 senses, then there are $2^n$ possible sense combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy:**\n",
    "A way to check how accurate the system is would be to print every sentence with the words `molecular, temperature and membrane` and ensure that the correct most likely sense has been given to each word. The code below I have printed `all sentences with the word temperature`, which there is a number of `88` sentences. After reading through each sentences, the **majority** of the sentences relate to: *the degree of hotness or coldness of a body or environment (corresponding to its molecular activity) i.e having a fever*, while the other sentences relate to the *somatic sensation of cold or heat*. This is not the best way to evalute your results as it would take a very long time if there where more documents and more frequent word sense being derived. From the basic evaluaiton done, I can conclude my system is accurate at determining the most likely sense of each occurrence of the word temperature."
